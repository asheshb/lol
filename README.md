#### LOL (Laugh Out Loud) - Build it Bigger - Project 4, Android Nanodegree Course, Udacity

This app was focussed on the working of Gradle.

Few things I learned/ implemented in this project:

* Gradle tasks
* Connected test
* Google cloud endpoint
* Interstitial ads
* Multiple flavors of an app (free/paid)
